<p><i>Myst Online: Uru Live</i> is a massive multiplayer online game in which you explore visually stunning worlds and solve puzzles, together with your friends and with people all over the world.

<p><i>Myst Online: Uru Live</i> (or <i>MO:UL</i> for short) is the last incarnation of <i>Uru</i>, a series of adventure games starting with <i>Uru: Ages Beyond Myst</i> and spanning <i>Uru: To D&#8217;ni</i> and <i>Uru: The Path Of The Shell</i>. Its storyline is a continuation of the story from <i>Myst</i> and <i>Riven</i>, two games previously created by <i>Cyan Worlds</i>. It also incorporates the stories from <i>The Myst Reader</i>: <i>Myst: The Book of Atrus</i>, <i>Myst: The Book of Ti&#8217;ana</i>, and <i>Myst: The Book of D&#8217;ni</i>.

<p>The client, servers and tools of <i>Myst Online: Uru Live</i>—also known as the <i>Plasma</i> engine—will soon become open source, allowing fans to continue developing the game and its universe.
