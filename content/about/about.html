<p><em>Myst Online: Uru Live</em> is a massive multiplayer online game in which you explore visually stunning worlds and solve puzzles, together with your friends and with people all over the world. Explorers like you create their own avatars, chat via text and voice, and take journeys together. They rediscover, restore and rebuild the ancient city of D&#8217;ni and learn about the history of its fallen civilization.</p>

<p><em>Myst Online: Uru Live</em> (or <em>MO:UL</em> for short) is the last incarnation of <em>Uru</em>, a series of adventure games starting with <em>Uru: Ages Beyond Myst</em> and spanning <em>Uru: To D&#8217;ni</em> and <em>Uru: The Path Of The Shell</em>. Its storyline is a continuation of the story from <em>Myst</em> and <em>Riven</em>, two games previously created by <em>Cyan Worlds</em>. It also incorporates the stories from <em>The Myst Reader</em>: <em>Myst: The Book of Atrus</em>, <em>Myst: The Book of Ti&#8217;ana</em>, and <em>Myst: The Book of D&#8217;ni</em>. For further details on Myst and Uru, we recommend <a href="http://en.mystlore.com/">MYSTlore</a>, a great fan-run encyclopedia of all things Myst.</p>

<p>The client, servers and tools of <em>Myst Online: Uru Live</em>—also known as the <em>Plasma</em> engine—will soon become open source, allowing fans to continue developing the game and its universe. In addition, fans will be able to host their own Uru servers and add custom, fan-made worlds for everyone to explore. For details, please see the <a href="/developers/">Developers</a> page.</p>

<p><em>Cyan Worlds</em> is a game development company located in Mead, near Spokane, Washington. They are most famous for <em>Myst</em>, the best-selling CD-ROM game of the 1990s. Other titles include <em>Riven: The Sequel to Myst</em>, as well as earlier children titles such as <em>The Manhole</em>.</p>
