<p>The D'ni Restoration Council (DRC) restarted its work after a three-year hiatus. Since its return, the council has been driven by Cate Alexander to push the restoration effort faster and faster, but some have wondered whether Cate's constant drive for progress was blinding her to the safety concerns being raised by other DRC members. Those fears recently came to pass as a cave-in took the life of Rose Taylor.</p>

<p>The cave-in also trapped Wheely Engberg, daughter of DRC member Michael Engberg. Wheely survived the initial cave-in but was killed soon thereafter. Mysteries still abound regarding the exact circumstances of her demise but it is known that there was a Bahro with her in her final hours. Wheely's death understandably greatly affected her father and Michael Engberg has since disappeared to parts unknown.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Douglas Sharper returned to the Age of Negilahn to further investigate the annihilation of the Age's animal population. Sharper recently discovered that the animal attacks were being perpetrated by a Bahro and more importantly, that the Bahro seem to be divided into factions (some incredibly violent) and that they are currently at war with one another. What the factions are fighting about remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The story continues in the next episode &ldquo;<strong>A New Light</strong>&rdquo; which begins on Saturday June 23.</p>
