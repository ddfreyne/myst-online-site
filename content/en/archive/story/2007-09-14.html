<p>After years away, Dr. Watson returned to the cavern. As the man responsible for the restoration of the cavern the first time, there were very few not anxious to hear what Dr. Watson had to say about the current restoration efforts. They were not disappointed. Questions that have been hovering in the cavern air for years were finally answered even in the future is still precarious.</p>

<p>Dr. Watson hinted that it may be up to explorers to find a way to make a home before the prophesied "destruction" comes. What that means is up for debate but there is good evidence that the Guilds, and the DRC's goals of restoring them, may play a part.</p>

<p>The war of the Bahro continues and, in fact, may be closer than any had suspected. Dr. Watson also explained the cavern we see is not what is happening. There is chaos and battles everywhere and only because the good Bahro are protecting us do we see anything different. Because of that Sharper has left again, this time in an effort to help the war and not be someone they need to help.</p>

<p>Michael Engberg has also returned after the tragedy involving his daughter that took place four months ago. Along with Dr. Watson they promise to focus on the restoration in a different manner than the DRC.</p>

<p>What that means for the future, only time will tell.</p>

<p>The story continues in the next episode, &ldquo;<strong>Exodus</strong>,&rdquo; which begins November 1st.</p>
