<p>The D'ni Restoration Council (DRC) has been hard at work for several months restoring the ancient cavern which was once the home to the D'ni. Recently a cave-in trapped Wheely Engberg, daughter of DRC member Michael Engberg. Wheely survived the initial cave-in but died soon thereafter. Mysteries still abound regarding the exact circumstances of her death, but it is known that one of the mysterious creatures known as the Bahro was with her in her final hours. Wheely's death greatly affected her father and Michael Engberg has since disappeared to parts unknown.</p>

<p> It was recently revealed that the Bahro are divided into two factions (one incredibly violent) and that the factions are currently at war with one another. What the factions are fighting over remains unknown. Many, including Douglas Sharper, blamed the "bad" Bahro for Wheely's death. Sharper visited their home of Noloben with the express purpose of taking revenge by killing a "bad" Bahro, but when he fired, one of the "good" Bahro sacrificed its life by jumping in front of the bullet.</p>

<p>Since the sacrifice, many Bahro have been seen within the cavern but their motives remain unclear. The presence of the Bahro within the cavern led to the mysterious return of Phil Henderson, a man who was thought to have died several years ago in a cave-in. Apparently, Phil somehow survived the cave-in and has been living with the Bahro ever since his "death." Phil warned everyone that the Bahro war would soon encompass the cavern.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the DRC began introducing a new Guild system to commemorate the ancient D'ni Guilds and have named the Explorer Reteltee as the DRC Guild Advisor. Other Explorers can show their allegiance to one of the five newly-created Guilds by donning an appropriate Guild shirt.</p>

<p>The story continues in the next episode, &ldquo;<strong>Deception</strong>,&rdquo; which begins on September 8.</p>
