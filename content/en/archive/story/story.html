	<h2>January 29, 2008</h2>

	<p>The first season of Uru saw much.</p>

	<p>Many of the Books the D'ni had written were found again: wonderful new Ages each with a beauty beyond imagination. A massive desert world called Minkata required explorers to use the stars and strange craters to navigate to mysterious caves. The playful and quirky Jalak allowed explorers to move massive stone pillars to create or to compete against one another. The mysterious Ahnonay allowed explorers to travel through time, thousands of years into the future, and discover how such time travel was possible. Mysterious observation pods that allowed people to look at strange creatures in a variety of landscapes, beautiful gardens, and the massive city itself.</p>

	<p>It was in the massive city, where the D'ni Restoration Council headquartered itself, determined to restore the once grand civilization back to its former glory.</p>

	<p>However, there were quickly problems: funding. Cate Alexander had come with promises of funding. She lasted for a while before determining that the "business" was not worth it.</p>

	<p>More importantly were the arrival of the Bahro. The Bahro were a race mentioned in the stories of the D'ni. A poor, lower class race who had recently been given freedom from their dominion. As a result, with freedom came the ability to choose. With choice, some chose evil and some chose good and war ensued.</p>

	<p>The war was brought to the cavern. Flying, vanishing at a moments notice, and screams filled the cavern as their battle grew. It was not long before their battle took the daughter of one of the DRC members and further destruction ensued.</p>

	<p>But none of this should have been a surprise. The prophecies always stated that destruction would come. Yeesha, the daughter of Atrus, the hero of Myst, had said as much. And toward the end of season one, she confirmed that destruction has begun. However, she also promised to lure the Bahro away, for a while. For as long as she could.</p>

	<p>And so it is empty again.</p>

	<p>The DRC has returned to the surface to find money.</p>

	<p>The Bahro have left and brought their war to other Ages.</p>

	<p>The explorers, wait. For the prophecies also said that it was vital to find a way and make a home.</p>

	<p>So there is hope. Hope for a way and a new home.</p>

	<p>After years away, Dr. Watson returned to the cavern. As the man responsible for the restoration of the cavern the first time, there were very few not anxious to hear what Dr. Watson had to say about the current restoration efforts. They were not disappointed. Questions that have been hovering in the cavern air for years were finally answered even in the future is still precarious.</p>

	<p>Dr. Watson hinted that it may be up to explorers to find a way to make a home before the prophesied "destruction" comes. What that means is up for debate but there is good evidence that the Guilds, and the DRC's goals of restoring them, may play a part.</p>

	<p>The war of the Bahro continues and, in fact, may be closer than any had suspected. Dr. Watson also explained the cavern we see is not what is happening. There is chaos and battles everywhere and only because the good Bahro are protecting us do we see anything different. Because of that Sharper has left again, this time in an effort to help the war and not be someone they need to help.</p>

	<p>Michael Engberg has also returned after the tragedy involving his daughter that took place four months ago. Along with Dr. Watson they promise to focus on the restoration in a different manner than the DRC.</p>

	<p>What that means for the future, only time will tell.</p>

	<p>The story continues in the next episode, &ldquo;<strong>Exodus</strong>,&rdquo; which begins November 1st.</p>

	<h2>August 8, 2007</h2>

	<p>The D'ni Restoration Council (DRC) has been hard at work for several months restoring the ancient cavern which was once the home to the D'ni. Recently a cave-in trapped Wheely Engberg, daughter of DRC member Michael Engberg. Wheely survived the initial cave-in but died soon thereafter. Mysteries still abound regarding the exact circumstances of her death, but it is known that one of the mysterious creatures known as the Bahro was with her in her final hours. Wheely's death greatly affected her father and Michael Engberg has since disappeared to parts unknown.</p>

	<p> It was recently revealed that the Bahro are divided into two factions (one incredibly violent) and that the factions are currently at war with one another. What the factions are fighting over remains unknown. Many, including Douglas Sharper, blamed the "bad" Bahro for Wheely's death. Sharper visited their home of Noloben with the express purpose of taking revenge by killing a "bad" Bahro, but when he fired, one of the "good" Bahro sacrificed its life by jumping in front of the bullet.</p>

	<p>Since the sacrifice, many Bahro have been seen within the cavern but their motives remain unclear. The presence of the Bahro within the cavern led to the mysterious return of Phil Henderson, a man who was thought to have died several years ago in a cave-in. Apparently, Phil somehow survived the cave-in and has been living with the Bahro ever since his "death." Phil warned everyone that the Bahro war would soon encompass the cavern.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, the DRC began introducing a new Guild system to commemorate the ancient D'ni Guilds and have named the Explorer Reteltee as the DRC Guild Advisor. Other Explorers can show their allegiance to one of the five newly-created Guilds by donning an appropriate Guild shirt.</p>

	<p>The story continues in the next episode, &ldquo;<strong>Deception</strong>,&rdquo; which begins on September 8.</p>

	<h2>June 28, 2007</h2>

	<p>The D'ni Restoration Council (DRC) has been hard at work for several months restoring the ancient cavern, which was once the home to the D'ni. Recently a cave-in trapped Wheely Engberg, daughter of DRC member Michael Engberg. Wheely survived the initial cave-in but died soon thereafter. Mysteries still abound regarding the exact circumstances of her death, but it is known that one of the mysterious creatures known as the Bahro was with her in her final hours. Wheely's death greatly affected her father and Michael Engberg has since disappeared to parts unknown.</p>

	<p>Michael Engberg's disappearance left a hole in the DRC leadership and a council election placed Cate Alexander in charge. Cate was responsible for originally obtaining funding for the DRC and the pressure is on now that additional funding is difficult to obtain. As a result, Cate wants to push the restoration effort faster and faster in order to generate results as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, many are blaming the Bahro for the cavern collapse which led to the death of Wheely Engberg and her friend Rose Taylor. It appears that the Bahro are divided into factions (some incredibly violent) and that the factions are currently at war with one another. What the factions are fighting over remains to be seen.</p>

	<p>Despite all of the current struggles and the looming threat of a potential Bahro war, the DRC intends to stay the course and continue dedicating itself to the restoration effort. The story continues in the next episode &ldquo;<strong>Familiar Voices</strong>&rdquo; which begins on Monday, July 30.</p>

	<h2>May 31, 2007</h2>

	<p>The D'ni Restoration Council (DRC) restarted its work after a three-year hiatus. Since its return, the council has been driven by Cate Alexander to push the restoration effort faster and faster, but some have wondered whether Cate's constant drive for progress was blinding her to the safety concerns being raised by other DRC members. Those fears recently came to pass as a cave-in took the life of Rose Taylor.</p>

	<p>The cave-in also trapped Wheely Engberg, daughter of DRC member Michael Engberg. Wheely survived the initial cave-in but was killed soon thereafter. Mysteries still abound regarding the exact circumstances of her demise but it is known that there was a Bahro with her in her final hours. Wheely's death understandably greatly affected her father and Michael Engberg has since disappeared to parts unknown.</p>

	<p>In the meantime, Douglas Sharper returned to the Age of Negilahn to further investigate the annihilation of the Age's animal population. Sharper recently discovered that the animal attacks were being perpetrated by a Bahro and more importantly, that the Bahro seem to be divided into factions (some incredibly violent) and that they are currently at war with one another. What the factions are fighting about remains to be seen.</p>

	<p>The story continues in the next episode &ldquo;<strong>A New Light</strong>&rdquo; which begins on Saturday June 23.</p>

	<h2>History</h2>

	<p>Over 10,000 years ago, the D'ni civilization established an underground empire on Earth. The D'ni people developed "The Art of Writing" which allowed them to create "Linking Books" which would allow them to travel to incredible worlds called "Ages."</p>

	<p>The D'ni thrived for thousands of years, but suddenly met a great catastrophe that all but destroyed their civilization. Their underground lair was left uninhabited and their Linking Books and Ages were lost… until now.</p>

	<p>A group of explorers recently discovered the remnants of the D'ni civilization and have begun restoring the cavern in the hopes of learning the secrets of the D'ni people. The D'ni Restoration Council (DRC) have recently invited you to join them in the cavern and assist with their efforts. Will you? Should you? The choice is yours.</p>
