	<h2>History</h2>

	<p>Over 10,000 years ago, the D'ni civilization established an underground empire on Earth. The D'ni people developed "The Art of Writing" which allowed them to create "Linking Books" which would allow them to travel to incredible worlds called "Ages."</p>

	<p>The D'ni thrived for thousands of years, but suddenly met a great catastrophe that all but destroyed their civilization. Their underground lair was left uninhabited and their Linking Books and Ages were lostâ€¦ until now.</p>

	<p>A group of explorers recently discovered the remnants of the D'ni civilization and have begun restoring the cavern in the hopes of learning the secrets of the D'ni people. The D'ni Restoration Council (DRC) have recently invited you to join them in the cavern and assist with their efforts. Will you? Should you? The choice is yours.</p>
