<p>The first season of Uru saw much.</p>

<p>Many of the Books the D'ni had written were found again: wonderful new Ages each with a beauty beyond imagination. A massive desert world called Minkata required explorers to use the stars and strange craters to navigate to mysterious caves. The playful and quirky Jalak allowed explorers to move massive stone pillars to create or to compete against one another. The mysterious Ahnonay allowed explorers to travel through time, thousands of years into the future, and discover how such time travel was possible. Mysterious observation pods that allowed people to look at strange creatures in a variety of landscapes, beautiful gardens, and the massive city itself.</p>

<p>It was in the massive city, where the D'ni Restoration Council headquartered itself, determined to restore the once grand civilization back to its former glory.</p>

<p>However, there were quickly problems: funding. Cate Alexander had come with promises of funding. She lasted for a while before determining that the "business" was not worth it.</p>

<p>More importantly were the arrival of the Bahro. The Bahro were a race mentioned in the stories of the D'ni. A poor, lower class race who had recently been given freedom from their dominion. As a result, with freedom came the ability to choose. With choice, some chose evil and some chose good and war ensued.</p>

<p>The war was brought to the cavern. Flying, vanishing at a moments notice, and screams filled the cavern as their battle grew. It was not long before their battle took the daughter of one of the DRC members and further destruction ensued.</p>

<p>But none of this should have been a surprise. The prophecies always stated that destruction would come. Yeesha, the daughter of Atrus, the hero of Myst, had said as much. And toward the end of season one, she confirmed that destruction has begun. However, she also promised to lure the Bahro away, for a while. For as long as she could.</p>

<p>And so it is empty again.</p>

<p>The DRC has returned to the surface to find money.</p>

<p>The Bahro have left and brought their war to other Ages.</p>

<p>The explorers, wait. For the prophecies also said that it was vital to find a way and make a home.</p>

<p>So there is hope. Hope for a way and a new home.</p>
