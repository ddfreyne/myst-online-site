<p>The D'ni Restoration Council (DRC) has been hard at work for several months restoring the ancient cavern, which was once the home to the D'ni. Recently a cave-in trapped Wheely Engberg, daughter of DRC member Michael Engberg. Wheely survived the initial cave-in but died soon thereafter. Mysteries still abound regarding the exact circumstances of her death, but it is known that one of the mysterious creatures known as the Bahro was with her in her final hours. Wheely's death greatly affected her father and Michael Engberg has since disappeared to parts unknown.</p>

<p>Michael Engberg's disappearance left a hole in the DRC leadership and a council election placed Cate Alexander in charge. Cate was responsible for originally obtaining funding for the DRC and the pressure is on now that additional funding is difficult to obtain. As a result, Cate wants to push the restoration effort faster and faster in order to generate results as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, many are blaming the Bahro for the cavern collapse which led to the death of Wheely Engberg and her friend Rose Taylor. It appears that the Bahro are divided into factions (some incredibly violent) and that the factions are currently at war with one another. What the factions are fighting over remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Despite all of the current struggles and the looming threat of a potential Bahro war, the DRC intends to stay the course and continue dedicating itself to the restoration effort. The story continues in the next episode &ldquo;<strong>Familiar Voices</strong>&rdquo; which begins on Monday, July 30.</p>
