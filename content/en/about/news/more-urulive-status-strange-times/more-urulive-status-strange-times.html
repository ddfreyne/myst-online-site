<p>Sorry for the long silence, things have been quickly shifting in these strange times.</p>

<p>Even though the development of <i><abbr class="acronym" title="Myst Online Restoration Experiment">MORE</abbr> Uru Live</i> has been progressing (the new account system is nearly done!), I'm sorry to say that outside events have caused us to put this project on indefinite hold.</p>

<p>The <i><abbr class="acronym" title="Myst Online Restoration Experiment">MORE</abbr></i> project was not funded directly but was riding on the coat tails of other projects. Unfortunately and very suddenly, a major revenue stream to Cyan was disrupted. The current Wall Street problems have had a significant, although indirect, effect.</p>

<p>We have no alternative than to put this project on hold. The ultimate future of <i><abbr class="acronym" title="Myst Online Restoration Experiment">MORE</abbr> Uru Live</i> will be determined over the coming months. If or when moneys become available we will reassess the roadmap at that time.</p>

<p>Currently, Cyan is redirecting its priorities to focus only on fully funded projects. Of which, Myst for the iPhone/iPod Touch is one of and that project is progressing very well.</p>

<p>From all of us at Cyan, thank you for all your support.</p>
