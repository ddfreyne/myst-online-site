<p>Shorah fans of Cyan,</p>

<p>As you may be aware, Cyan's situation has not improved on the "resources" front. We continue to work on small projects (including Myst for the iPhone/iPod Touch), and it looks like we will only be able to concentrate on projects that are fully funded for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>However, all of us at Cyan and everybody that has ever worked on the creation and building of the dream called Uru Live (a.k.a. Mudpie, Unt√¨l Uru, Myst Online: Uru Live and <abbr class="acronym" title="Myst Online: Restoration Experiment">MORE</abbr>) can not just let it die! (My definitions: "Uru Live" is the original dream of the virtual world. And "Myst Online" is the current implementation of Uru Live.)</p>

<p>So, Cyan has decided to give make Myst Online available to the fans by releasing the source code for the servers, client and tools for Myst Online as an open source project. We will also host a data server with the data for Myst Online. <abbr class="acronym" title="Myst Online: Restoration Experiment">MORE</abbr> is still possible but only with the help from fans.</p>

<p>This is a bit scary for Cyan because this is an area that we have never gone before, to let a product freely roam in the wild. But we've poured so much into Uru Live, and it has touched so many, that we could not just let it whither and die. We still have hopes that someday we will be able to provide new content for Uru Live and/or work on the next Uru Live.</p>

<p>This is also a bit scary for the fans. We realize that this could turn Uru Live into the "wild west" and lead to many fractured and diverse Myst Online servers. But it is our hope that with the help of dedicated core fans (if you are reading this, it probably means you) that a safe and secure Myst Online server set (many servers from around the world working together as one) can be created that will let people explore and live in Uru Live.</p>

<p>We also are pretty sure that releasing Myst Online will result in some pleasant surprises for us. Our fans have always been so innovative, creative, and resourceful!</p>

<p>This release will probably be accomplished in stages, but we hope to get things ready for the first stage very quickly. More details to surely follow.</p>
