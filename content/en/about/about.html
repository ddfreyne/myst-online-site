<p>Myst Online: Uru Live is a massive multiplayer online game in which you explore visually stunning worlds and solve puzzles, together with your friends and with people all over the world. Explorers like you create their own avatars, chat via text and voice, and take journeys together. They rediscover, restore and rebuild the ancient city of D&#8217;ni and learn about the history of its fallen civilization.</p>

<p>Myst Online: Uru Live (or <abbr class="acronym" title="Myst Online: Uru Live">MO:UL</abbr> for short) is the last incarnation of Uru, a series of adventure games starting with Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and spanning Uru: To D'ni and Uru: The Path Of The Shell. Its storyline is a continuation of the story from Myst and Riven, two games previously created by Cyan Worlds. It also incorporates the stories from The Myst Reader: Myst: The Book of Atrus, Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, and Myst: The Book of D'ni.

In addition, fans will be able to host their own Uru servers and add custom, fan-made worlds for everyone to explore. For details, please see the <a href="/en/developers/">Developers</a> page.</p>
